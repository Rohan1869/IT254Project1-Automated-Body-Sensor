# IT254Project1-Automated-Body-Sensor
This project integrates an Arduino Mega 2560, Google Teachable Machine, and Python to create a face-detection-based security system which can also serve as a body sensor for multitude of reasons. When the system detects a face, it triggers an LED on the Arduino board using Serial Communication.
